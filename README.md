The Key A is direction to the left, the key s is for down direction, the key is for the direction for right and the key w is for the direction up.

The Interaction here is that character is trying to save his friend  by finding the keys and unlocked the doors.


This is a very challenging task and The're some part of the code that is not mine and some parts are modified and implemented  That's why  I acknowledged the effort of Mr. RyiSnow for creating a tutorial videos for 2D games. This served as a guide for me to start this project. You can check his tutorial videos by visiting his Youtube Channel https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow
I've Implemented sound effects for this game. The sound effects is from https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/
